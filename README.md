Created a To Do List that uses HTML, CSS, EJS to add HTML content dynamically, Express to create the server and render files everytime POST and GET requests are made and MongoDB to store list items. Displays current date and tasks added for the day. Strikes a line through tasks when checked by the user and then deletes that item from the database.
